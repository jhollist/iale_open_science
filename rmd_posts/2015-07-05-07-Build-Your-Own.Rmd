The final lesson for this workshop is a culmination of everything we have seen so far.  We will be spending this entire hour working on building up a Markdown document.  In this document we will pull in some data, do some simple analysis, create a figure or two, create a table and then render the document to pdf (if LaTeX is installed) or HTML.  So you all can spend more time building the document, we've provided a skeleton .Rmd to start with.  In that skeleton we've laid out some different sections with directions.  You just need to fill in the code and provide some explantory text (with Markdown, of course).
